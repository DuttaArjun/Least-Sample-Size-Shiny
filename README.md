# Least-Sample-Size-Shiny
This is an extension of the previous project on Least Sample Size required for Convergence to Normality with a User Interface using Shiny.
I have saved the script in github and run the shiny app directly from R using the following commands below:-

install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
runGitHub("DuttaArjun/Least-Sample-Size-Shiny", "app.R", subdir= "LeastSampleSize/app.R")
